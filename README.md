This is the repositery of my website's code. It's not that important since it's not meant to be reusable. I can tell, the code isn't interesting at all...

Read this piece of unsecured and not well-designed at all code only if you want to find some big security fails to break down my website :)

This has been built using Symfony 5 and PhpStorm (which is, as you may know, not a technology but an IDE)

I hope I'll finish this shit one day.

### Powered by open-sourced project
* Symfony 5

### Used software
* Stormbringer (aka PHPStorm), by Jetbrains.
